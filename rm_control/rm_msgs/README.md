### Building from Source

#### Building

To build from source, clone the latest version from this repository into your catkin workspace and compile the package
using

	cd catkin_workspace/src
	git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/rm_msgs.git
	cd ../
	rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src
	catkin_make

[comment]: <> (### Running in Docker)

[comment]: <> (Docker is a great way to run an application with all dependencies and libraries bundles together. Make sure)

[comment]: <> (to [install Docker]&#40;https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/&#41; first.)

[comment]: <> (First, spin up a simple container:)

[comment]: <> (	docker run -ti --rm --name ros-container ros:noetic bash)

[comment]: <> (This downloads the `ros:noetic` image from the Docker Hub, indicates that it requires an interactive terminal &#40;`-t, -i`&#41;)

[comment]: <> (, gives it a name &#40;`--name`&#41;, removes it after you exit the container &#40;`--rm`&#41; and runs a command &#40;`bash`&#41;.)

[comment]: <> (Now, create a catkin workspace, clone the package, build it, done!)

[comment]: <> (	apt-get update && apt-get install -y git)

[comment]: <> (	mkdir -p /ws/src && cd /ws/src)

[comment]: <> (	git clone https://github.com/leggedrobotics/ros_best_practices.git)

[comment]: <> (	cd ..)

[comment]: <> (	rosdep install --from-path src)

[comment]: <> (	catkin_make)

[comment]: <> (	source devel/setup.bash)

## Packages

### msgs

#### ActuatorState.msgs

This message contains the state of An actuator contains a motor and an encoder, and is connected to a joint by a
transmission.

- time[] stamp

  The time at which this actuator state was measured

- string[] name

  The name of the actuator

- string[] type

  The type of the actuator

- string[] bus

  The CAN bus

- int32[] id

  The CAN id

- bool[] halted

  Indicates if the motor is halted. A motor can be halted because of a voltage or temperature problem

- bool[] need_calibration

  calibration

- bool[] calibration_reading

  The value of the calibration reading: low (false) or high (true)

- uint16[] position_raw

  The encoder raw position, represented by the number of encoder ticks

- int16[] velocity_raw

  The encoder velocity, represented by rpm

- uint8[] temperature

  The temperature of the motor, represented by c1elsius

- int64[]  circle
